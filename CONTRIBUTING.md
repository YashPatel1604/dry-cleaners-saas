# Contributing

This is currently a single-developer project.

## Workflow
- Work in small branches:
  - `feat/<name>`
  - `fix/<name>`
  - `chore/<name>`
  - `docs/<name>`
- Open a PR (even if you're the only dev) to keep history clean and force a checklist.

## Commit Convention

- `feat: ...`
- `fix: ...`
- `chore: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `refactor: ...`
- `test: ...`

## Definition of Done
